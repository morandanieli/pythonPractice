This task has two sections:

  1. In section #1, you'll build a Sudoko validator. Instructions here: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/

  2. In section #2 you'll build a Sudoko solver. Instructions here: https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/


Once code is ready, in order to connect it to the prebuilt UI, incorpoerate your code in the entry points found in `sudoku_practice` directory

The solution can be found in `sudoku_solution` directory

Good luck!
